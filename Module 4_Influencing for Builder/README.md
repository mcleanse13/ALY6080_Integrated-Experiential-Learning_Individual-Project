Data-Driven Decision-Making and Organizational Readiness for Digital Transformation

In this module, I explored how data informs organizational decision-making and the ways leaders evaluate, interpret, and act on the information available to them. I examined the strengths and limitations of using data in business contexts, reflected on how decision-makers navigate uncertainty, and identified the additional data needs and open questions relevant to my XN client project. This module helped me deepen my understanding of how analytical thinking supports strategic choices and what challenges modern data environments pose for leaders.

As part of the assignment, I completed an annotated bibliography to build the domain expertise necessary for my final project. For the third article, I analyzed How to Digitalize Your Sales Organization by Sinha et al. (2022), which discusses the organizational and cultural shifts required for successful digital transformation. My summary focused on how data technologies reshape sales operations, the barriers companies face in digital adoption, and the importance of aligning roles, collaboration, and decision-making with digital processes. This research directly supports the business question for my project by highlighting the need for strategic planning, cross-functional coordination, and skill development when integrating data-driven systems into existing workflows.
