# ALY6080_Integrated-Experiential-Learning_Individual Project

For my individual project, I developed a comprehensive proposal for Yeoman Technology Company to guide their transition from traditional multi-channel sales to digital platforms like Amazon. My focus was on creating a data-driven strategy that ensures this shift enhances revenue growth without negatively impacting existing client businesses or retail channels. To achieve this, I outlined a phased approach that includes selecting and implementing analytical tools, training staff, and establishing clear communication practices. I incorporated predictive modeling, customer segmentation, and descriptive analytics using tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel to provide actionable insights, optimize sales strategies, and support data-driven decision-making throughout the transition.

In addition, I emphasized continuous monitoring and evaluation to maintain alignment with business goals and adapt to changing market conditions. By using historical and current sales data, conducting impact analyses, and implementing iterative improvements, I designed a framework that balances digital expansion with existing operations. I also integrated employee training programs and a user-friendly dashboard to enable effective interpretation of analytics and actionable reporting. Overall, this project reflects my ability to leverage data analytics for strategic planning, operational execution, and long-term business growth, while ensuring stakeholder confidence and organizational adaptability in a dynamic digital landscape.
