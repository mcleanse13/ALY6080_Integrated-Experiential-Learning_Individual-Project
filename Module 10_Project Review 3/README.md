Finalized Data-Driven Strategy for Yeoman Technology’s Digital Transition

For this stage of my individual project, I focused on finalizing my project proposal and incorporating feedback from previous drafts to ensure it reflects a comprehensive and actionable strategy for Yeoman Technology Company’s transition to digital platforms. In this draft, I detail the business question, which centers on making sure the shift to platforms like Amazon does not negatively affect existing client businesses or retail channels. I expanded the scope of my project into three phases: selecting and implementing analytical tools, training staff and identifying essential skills, and establishing effective communication practices to preempt potential challenges. Throughout the proposal, I rely on historical and current data to guide predictive modeling, customer segmentation, and descriptive analytics, using tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel to inform actionable insights and optimize performance across all sales channels.

I also focused on translating my research from the annotated bibliography into practical strategies, highlighting how digital transformation affects business models, customer relationships, and operational processes. By integrating predictive analytics and data-driven strategies into the project design, I aim to support Yeoman Technology Company in enhancing its digital footprint while protecting existing channels. Additionally, I included employee training initiatives and dashboard visualizations to ensure that the company can continuously monitor performance, adapt to evolving market conditions, and maintain strong stakeholder trust. Overall, this draft represents a near-finalized blueprint for using data analytics to guide strategic decisions, optimize operations, and achieve a smooth and beneficial digital transition.
