Developing Domain Expertise on Digital Customer Engagement and Sales Performance

In this stage of my individual project, I continued developing domain expertise by exploring how digital transformation affects customer relationships and sales performance. My research focused on understanding the types of data my sponsor might provide and how those datasets support the broader business question I am addressing. To deepen this understanding, I analyzed a peer-reviewed article that examines the balance between digital customer engagement and the human touch which is an essential dynamic for companies transitioning into multi-channel or fully digital environments. This work helped me think critically about the analytical tools, statistical approaches, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques that will guide my project as I refine the key question my analysis will ultimately answer.

The article I reviewed emphasized that while digital platforms create speed, transparency, and convenience, customers still rely on human interaction at specific points in the buying journey. This reinforced the importance of integrating digital strategy with traditional customer-centric practices, which directly aligns with my sponsor’s business challenge of moving into digital marketplaces without undermining existing non-digital channels. By connecting the article’s insights to the sponsor’s objectives, I strengthened my ability to interpret domain-specific data, identify what datasets are necessary for meaningful analysis, and build a roadmap for the analytical methods I will apply in the next phase of the project.
