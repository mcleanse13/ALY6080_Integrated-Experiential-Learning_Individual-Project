In this project, I focused on developing a professional project proposal for my XN sponsor by integrating the research and annotated bibliography I built over the previous modules. I examined how digital transformation, customer interaction, and data-driven decision-making influence modern business models, and used these insights to shape a practical proposal grounded in the sponsor’s industry. By reviewing peer-reviewed literature on digital sales adoption, multichannel customer engagement, and organizational adaptation, I strengthened my understanding of the challenges companies face when shifting from traditional operations to digital platforms. This research directly informed the structure and rationale of my proposal.

Using this foundation, I drafted a project plan aimed at helping my sponsor navigate the transition of multichannel brands into online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. I outlined the project background, scope, data collection methods, and implementation strategies, emphasizing predictive analytics, employee training, and improved communication frameworks. In first person, this project reflects my ability to dissect complex organizational problems, define clear analytical approaches, and communicate structured solutions that a sponsor could confidently evaluate and implement on their own timeline.
