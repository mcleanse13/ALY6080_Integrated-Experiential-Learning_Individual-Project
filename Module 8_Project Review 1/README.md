For this phase of my individual project, I expanded my initial proposal into a full working draft that reflects both instructor feedback and the analytical methods I’ve learned throughout the program. In this proposal, I focus on how I would guide Yeoman Technology Company as it transitions multi-channel brands onto digital platforms like Amazon without disrupting existing retail operations. I outline a structured plan centered on predictive analytics, customer segmentation, and descriptive data visualization—each supported by industry research from my annotated bibliography. I explain the types of data I would request from the sponsor, the analytical tools I would apply, and the assumptions and limitations that need to be addressed for a successful digital transformation.

In this draft, I also build out my methodology, including recommended analytical tools (Python, R, SQL, Tableau, AWS), a phased implementation strategy, and considerations such as employee training, change management, and communication planning. I describe how dashboards, forecasting models, and customer-group analysis would help the sponsor optimize performance on digital marketplaces while maintaining brand consistency across channels. This README reflects my evolving understanding of how to apply data analytics to real-world business challenges and sets the foundation for my final proposal.
