In this stage of my project, I focused on developing deeper domain expertise by researching how digital transformation is reshaping modern business models. To do this, I selected an article by Bernard Marr (2023), which examines the opportunities and challenges companies face as they shift toward digital-first strategies. In my summary, I highlighted Marr’s discussion of how organizations are leveraging technology to optimize products, strengthen customer relationships, and redesign their operations. This research directly supports the business question I am addressing for my sponsor, as it provides real-world examples of how businesses are transitioning to digital platforms without disrupting existing revenue channels.

I also reflected on Marr’s insights into several industries—including retail, manufacturing, and service sectors—where analytics, automation, and data-driven customer understanding are driving transformation. Marr explains how companies like Amazon and eBay influenced traditional retailers to adopt digital practices, and how modern technologies require new skills, training, and attention to data privacy. This article helped me understand the broader context of digital transformation and reinforced the importance of aligning analytical tools, workforce readiness, and communication strategies when proposing solutions for my sponsor’s digital transition.
