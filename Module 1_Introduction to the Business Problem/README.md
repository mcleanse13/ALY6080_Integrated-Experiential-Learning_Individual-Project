Foundational Analytics Proposal for Yeoman Technology’s Digital Sales Strategy

This project introduces a foundational analytical proposal developed for the Yeoman Technology Company (YTC), an organization that guides traditional retail brands through their transition into digital marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. The proposal begins by examining YTC’s business model and identifies a key strategic question: How can YTC optimize digital sales without disrupting legacy revenue streams and established retail partnerships? To address this, the project outlines a series of analytics-driven objectives focused on predictive modeling, workforce training, and enhanced communication workflows that are each designed to support a balanced integration of digital and non-digital business operations.

The proposal also defines a structured three-phase project scope, integrating analytical tool selection, employee skill development, and improved cross-department collaboration. Drawing on academic literature, the project highlights the importance of brand management, customer engagement, management innovation, and data-driven decision-making during digital transformation. The final recommendation emphasizes the use of dashboards, forecasting models, and AWS simulations to support future strategic decisions. This proposal serves as both a demonstration of analytical thinking and an example of designing a real-world data strategy aligned with business needs.
