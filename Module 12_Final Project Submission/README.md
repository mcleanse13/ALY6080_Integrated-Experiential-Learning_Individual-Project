Data-Driven Digital Transformation Strategy for Yeoman Technology Company

For my final individual project, I focused on consolidating all previous drafts and feedback into a comprehensive proposal for Yeoman Technology Company. My goal was to outline a clear, data-driven strategy to support the transition of multi-channel brands from traditional sales channels to digital platforms like Amazon, while ensuring that existing client businesses and retail channels remain protected. In this final draft, I detail a structured, phased approach: selecting and implementing analytical tools, training staff and identifying critical skills, and establishing effective communication practices. I incorporated predictive modeling, customer segmentation, and descriptive analytics—leveraging tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel to generate actionable insights, optimize sales strategies, and monitor ongoing performance.

This project proposal also emphasizes continuous evaluation and improvement, including quantitative metrics, stakeholder feedback, and team accountability, ensuring the company can adapt and refine strategies over time. By integrating big data analytics with employee training and a user-friendly dashboard, I aim to provide Yeoman Technology Company with the framework to successfully expand its digital footprint while enhancing customer engagement and operational efficiency. Overall, this final draft demonstrates a practical application of data analytics to drive strategic decision-making, maximize revenue growth, and support long-term resilience in an evolving market landscape.
